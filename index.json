For the past 6 weeks, we\u0026rsquo;ve had the pre-ramp phase, where we already started chatting with other founders and Antler coaches, mentors and partners.\nFor those that don\u0026rsquo;t know, Antler is a 12-week program that helps you meet like-minded founders and work on ideas in a systematic way. At the end of the program, you present your progress to an Investment Committee to see if your startup will get funded by Antler VCs. If so, they also help you with raising more capital down the road, make connections with industry, validating ideas, etc. If you don\u0026rsquo;t get funded, you\u0026rsquo;d still be a part of the Antler community, which is also super valuable in my opinion.\nThe Nordics program runs in four cities: Oslo, Stockholm, Helsinki and Copenhagen. So far, I think there are almost 200 people combined.\nMy approach to Antler First, I feel very fortunate to be part of an extraordinary group that wants to change the world in positive ways. Getting to know the people around me feels like a super win already. Furthermore, I do feel that anything can happen in 12 weeks. Maybe you find the perfect team, a great idea, validation and get funded, but maybe you don\u0026rsquo;t. This is my first time that I try to raise funding from VCs so I\u0026rsquo;m not the most experienced in this area. But I do feel that beyond whether you get funding or not, the connections, people we meet, and even new friends we make here are so valuable in and on themselves. So I do hope to forge long lasting relationships with driven, ambitious people that want to have positive impact in the world.\nWhat we\u0026rsquo;ve done so far We\u0026rsquo;ve had two online Meet \u0026amp; Greets, where we\u0026rsquo;ve been introduced to the program and to other founders. On these calls, after all program intros, we\u0026rsquo;ve been assigned to different groups to start getting to know each other more. I\u0026rsquo;ve even met one founder that happens to live a couple of blocks from me and we\u0026rsquo;ve already met (families and all) and have had a great time!\nAlso, we have our own Slack Workspace for communications and intros. So every founder introduces themselves with background, mission, hobbies, Loom video, etc. Then, we start reaching out and start making connections. We also have an ideas channel for people to share what they want to work on, get advice, validation, questions, feedback and so on.\nLots of resources have been shared with us already. Some of it can feel overwhelming as there is a lot of information. Also, on the overwhelming feeling, trying to connect with 200 people is also quite the endeavour, but I\u0026rsquo;m planning to take one step at a time.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve also had a couple of talks: one on Trends \u0026amp; Exciting Ideas and one on How to Discover Your Start-Up Idea, by Oscar Wetergård. Next up, we will have a talk on Building a VC Backable Company with Anne Solhaug Tutar. All super exciting!\nI\u0026rsquo;ve also started some preliminary work with other founders on a couple of ideas. One of them around circular economy and another on helping people discover new knowledge with an AI-copilot. The latter one I\u0026rsquo;m very excited about.\nLooking ahead When I entered Antler, I wanted to work on solutions that can help climate change. I\u0026rsquo;m worried about how some regions can become inhabitable by droughts, extreme heat and extreme weather. Since my expertise is in Machine Learning and AI, I\u0026rsquo;d like to explore solutions that can leverage this tech. However, I do feel the tech (AI or not) is secondary in importance, rather the goal itself (e.g., reducing GHG, Helping the world transition to clean renewable energy). Currently, I don\u0026rsquo;t have the domain knowledge on how to best help the climate, but I\u0026rsquo;m learning. If anyone has ideas on this space, I\u0026rsquo;d love to hear them.\nIn any case, I\u0026rsquo;m super excited to be a part of the program. A huge thanks to all the organizers for making all of this happen. It\u0026rsquo;s been amazing so far, and we are only at the pre-ramp phase. I can\u0026rsquo;t wait for the actual program to start in just 5 days and see what we build together and how we change the world.\nIf you liked this update, let me know so that I can share further updates on the Antler program as we along.\n","image":"https://mlgal.github.io/images/posts/looking_up.jpg","permalink":"https://mlgal.github.io/blogs/2024.02.07.post/","tags":null,"title":"Antler Program T-5days"},{"categories":["Waste","Analytics","Object Detection","Deep Learning"],"contents":"At Greyparrot.ai, I helped build a world-class waste analytics platform. I led the Deep Learning team to create a system that automatically recognizes all trash items going through recycling facilities, helping recover all valuable materials and converting them to assets. Cameras were installed on top of conveyor belts that transport waste. Our tech accurately recognized around 50 distinct object categories and hundreds of brands, empowering robotic manipulation and data-driven insights.\nAs Head of the Deep Learning team, I managed the end-to-end process – from image intake to model creation, evaluation and deployment. I helped design and implement this process such that the full pipeline is done continuously with as little human input as possible. During my position, we had recognized billions of objects (yes, we humans create a lot of trash!), and we were able to recognize them with less than 5% error rate on each waste stream.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a demo of our waste recognition system:\nYour browser does not support the video tag. One important challenge we overcame was reducing the need of massive amounts of high-quality annotated data for our Deep Learning models to work well. We developed an algorithm that helps the neural network identify objects that should be added to training set, so that only the most informative data is annotated. This helped us reduce annotation efforts by 100x.\nI was very proud to be able to drive such an important technology to help reduce our waste and footprint on the planet.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a video where I explain this work further\nAlso, here\u0026rsquo;s a blog post of what a \u0026ldquo;Day in the Life\u0026rdquo; was for me as the Head of the Deep Learning team.\nAnd don\u0026rsquo;t forget to heck out the amazing work at Greyparrot.ai\n","image":"https://mlgal.github.io/images/greyparrot.jpg","permalink":"https://mlgal.github.io/blogs/post-10/","tags":["Waste","Analytics","Object Detection","Deep Learning"],"title":"Waste Analytics System for Greyparrot.ai"},{"categories":["Contrastive Learning","Object Detection","Deep Learning"],"contents":"I gave a talk about how we are using Computer Vision to detect and track all waste through recycling facilities for the Women in Data Science group.\n","image":"https://mlgal.github.io/images/talk_wids.jpg","permalink":"https://mlgal.github.io/blogs/post-11/","tags":["Talk","Contrastive Learning","Object Detection","Deep Learning"],"title":"Talk: Computer Vision for Recycling and Waste Management"},{"categories":["NASA","SETI","Image Processing","Deep Learning","Convolutional Neural Network","LSTMs"],"contents":"Together with my team, I gave a talk on how we can provide more warning time in case a long-period comet happens to be in a collision trajectory with Earth. .\n","image":"https://mlgal.github.io/images/nasa_talk.jpg","permalink":"https://mlgal.github.io/blogs/post-13/","tags":["Talk","NASA","SETI","Image Processing","Deep Learning","Convolutional Neural Network","LSTMs"],"title":"SETI Talk: Planetary Defense: Long Period Comets"},{"categories":["NASA","SETI","Image Processing","Deep Learning","Convolutional Neural Network","LSTMs"],"contents":"In planetary defence (yes! there is such a thing, where scientists and engineers try to defend the planet from hazards), long-period comets are recognized as the potentially most devastating threat. However, any new comet on an impact trajectory would likely only be discovered about one year before impact. The goal of this project is to add years of extra warning time by providing comet searchers directions on where to look for comets when they are still far out. To aid and guide a dedicated search for these dangerous objects, meteor showers may offer a clue. Comets leave debris trails as they travel along their orbits. When our planet intersects such debris trails, we see them as meteors. By detecting rare aperiodic meteor showers from dust clouds, we can estimate the orbit of the parent body and narrow down the search space where to look for long-period comets.\nThe Cameras for Allsky Meteor Surveillance or CAMS monitors the sky to detect meteors. Until now, processing the images has required time-consuming human input to rule out false positives. Automating this process allows to free the data analyst in CAMS and enable a global expansion and temporal coverage of the camera network that can detect the dust trails of those potentially hazardous long period comets that came close to Earth’s orbit in the past ten millennia. We developed deep learning tools that allow such automation. Specifically, we developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that discerns images of meteors vs. other objects in the sky and achieves precision and recall scores of 88.3% and 90.3%, respectively. In addition, we developed a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network that encodes the light curve tracklets into a latent space, and learns to predict whether the tracklet corresponds to a meteor or not. The LSTM achieves a precision of 90.0% and a recall of 89.1%. These methods can now be used by meteor astronomers to automatically analyze sky detections and help guide the search for long-period comets.\nCheck out our paper Searching for Long Period Comets with Deep Learning\nWorkshop on Deep Learning for Physical Sciences (DLPS 2017), NIPS 2017, Long Beach, CA, USA.\nSusana Zoghbi, Marcelo De Cicco, Antonio Ordoñez, Andres Plata Stapper, Peter S.

Millions of images are displayed everyday by fashion commerce sites to serve consumers the latest trends and products. However, automatically categorizing and searching through large collections of images according to fine-grained attributes remains a challenge. In this talk we present our research on deep learning techniques to automatically identify fine-grained attributes in both images and text in the presence of incomplete and noisy data. We focus on attributes such as necklines, skirt and sleeve shapes, patterns, textures, colors and occasions. This task is especially useful to online stores who might want to automatically organize and mine visual items according to their attributes without human input. It is also useful for end users who wish to find specific items when there is no text available describing the target image. We compare the results of the deep learning approach with classical techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Canonical Correlation Analysis. Our results show that it is possible to design algorithms that automatically “translate” visual concepts into text and vice-versa.\n","image":"https://mlgal.github.io/images/rework.jpg","permalink":"https://mlgal.github.io/blogs/post-12/","tags":["Talk","Contrastive Learning","Object Detection","Deep Learning"],"title":"Talk at ReWork: Deep Learning for Fashion Attributes Search"},{"categories":["Image Processing","Deep Learning"],"contents":"At Macty, we developed a novel in-store experience, where users can upload images of outfits and we suggest lingerie to pair it with.\nOur ‘Complete the Look’ application inspires customers while helping sellers increase the findability of their products and stimulate sales.”\nWe use advanced image recognition to detect visual attributes from outfits and lingerie to pair them together.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a demo of what this looks like:\n","image":"https://mlgal.github.io/images/macty_vdv.jpg","permalink":"https://mlgal.github.io/blogs/post-15/","tags":["Deep Learning","Retailers","Image Processing","Fashion","Lingerie"],"title":"Transforming the in-store shopping experience with AI"},{"categories":["Deep Learning","Convolutional Neural Network","Image Recognition","Topic Model","NLP"],"contents":"In this paper we develop a neural network which learns inter- modal representations for fashion attributes to be utilized in a cross-modal search tool. Our neural network learns from organic e-commerce data, which is characterized by clean image material, but noisy and incomplete product descrip- tions. First, we experiment with techniques to segment e- commerce images and their product descriptions into respec- tively image and text fragments denoting fashion attributes. Here, we propose a rule-based image segmentation approach which exploits the cleanness of e-commerce images. Next, we design an objective function which encourages our model to induce a common embedding space where a semantically related image fragment and text fragment have a high in- ner product. This objective function incorporates similarity information of image fragments to obtain better intermodal representations. A key insight is that similar looking image fragments should be described with the same text fragments. We explicitly require this in our objective function, and as such recover information which was lost due to noise and in- completeness in the product descriptions. We evaluate the inferred intermodal representations in cross-modal search. We demonstrate that the neural network model trained with our objective function on image fragments acquired with our rule-based segmentation approach improves the results of image search with textual queries by 198% for recall@1 and by 181% for recall@5 compared to results obtained by a state-of-the-art image search system on the same benchmark dataset.\nCheck out our paper Cross-modal Search for Fashion Attributes\nKDD Machine Learning Meets Fashion Workshop, 2017\nKatrien Laenen, Susana Zoghbi, Sien Moens\nPDF\n","image":"https://mlgal.github.io/images/inner_product.jpg","permalink":"https://mlgal.github.io/blogs/post-4/","tags":["Deep Learning","Convolutional Neural Network","Image Recognition","Topic Model","NLP"],"title":"Cross-modal Search for Fashion Attributes"},{"categories":["Deep Learning","Convolutional Neural Network","Image Recognition","Topic Model","NLP"],"contents":"Automatic linking of online content improves navigation possibilities for end users. We focus on linking content generated by users to other relevant sites. In particular, we study the problem of linking information between different usages of the same language, e.g., colloquial and formal idioms or the language of consumers versus the language of sellers. The challenge is that the same items are described using very distinct vocabularies. As a case study, we investigate a new task of linking textual Pinterest.com pins (colloquial) to online webshops (formal). We evaluate three different modeling paradigms based on probabilistic topic modeling: monolingual latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), bilingual LDA (BiLDA) and a novel multi-idiomatic LDA model (MiLDA). We compare these to the unigram model with Dirichlet prior. Our results for all three topic models reveal the usefulness of modeling the hidden thematic structure of the data through topics. Our proposed MiLDA model is able to deal with intrinsic multi-idiomatic data by considering the shared vocabulary between the aligned document pairs.\nCheck out our paper Latent Dirichlet Allocation for Linking User-Generated Content and e-Commerce Data\nInformation Sciences, 2016\nSusana Zoghbi, Ivan Vulic, Sien Moens\nPDF\n","image":"https://mlgal.github.io/images/sigir_img.png","permalink":"https://mlgal.github.io/blogs/post-2/","tags":["Deep Learning","Convolutional Neural Network","Image Recognition","Topic Model","NLP"],"title":"Latent Dirichlet Allocation for Linking User-Generated Content and e-Commerce Data"},{"categories":["Deep Learning","Convolutional Neural Network","Image Recognition","Topic Model","NLP"],"contents":"We study the problem of linking information between different idiomatic usages of the same language, for example, colloquial and formal language.

For example, it can be very difficult for an individual to manipulate a long or heavy object. An assistant can help to share the load, and improve the maneuverability of the object. Each partner can communicate objectives (e.g., move around an obstacle or put the object down) via non-verbal cues (e.g., moving the end of the object in a particular direction, changing speed, or tugging). Herein, non-verbal communication in a human-robot coordi- nated manipulation task is addressed using a small articulated robot arm equipped with a 6-axis wrist mounted force/torque sensor and joint angle encoders. The robot controller uses a Jacobian Transpose velocity PD control scheme with gravity compensation. To aid collaborative manipulation we implement a uniform impedance controller at the robot end-effector with an attractive force to a virtual path in the style of a cobot. Unlike a cobot, this path is recomputed online as a function of user input. In our present research, we utilize force/torque sensor measurements to identify intentional user communications specifying a change in the task direction. We consider the impact of path recomputation and the resulting robot haptic feedback on user physiological response.\nCheck out our paper Measuring Intent in Human-Robot Cooperative Manipulation\nProceedings of Workshop on Multimodal Human–Robot Interfaces, 2010 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA 2010)\nDavide De Carli, Evan Hohert, Chris AC Parker, Susana Zoghbi, Simon Leonard, Elizabeth Croft, Antonio Bicchi\nPDF\n","image":"https://mlgal.github.io/images/control.jpg","permalink":"https://mlgal.github.io/blogs/post-9/","tags":["Robotics","Control","Human Robot Interaction"],"title":"Measuring Intent in Human-Robot Cooperative Manipulation"}]
